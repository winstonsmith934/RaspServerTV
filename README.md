**RaspServerTV** is a personal project created to collect and display IPTV channels in a clean and organized way, directly from the browser. It provides an updated and filtered list of streaming channels from around the world, accessible anywhere.

---

## üîß How It Works

- A Bash script processes multiple `.m3u` source files organized by country (`italy.txt`, `uk.txt`, etc.).
- Dead links (e.g., 404, 500, 000) are automatically removed.
- Channels with 403 errors are fixed when possible (name, logo, link).
- The result is a cleaned master playlist: `original.m3u`.

---

## üåê Web Interface

- A lightweight HTML + JavaScript page loads the cleaned playlist.
- Channels are displayed by country, with logos and names.
- The site detects the user's location (via IP or VPN) and prioritizes channels from that country.
- Everything runs directly in the browser ‚Äî no installation needed.

üì∫ Video Resolution Detection

This feature detects the **video resolution** based on its height and returns a user-friendly label and a corresponding color code, ideal for UI indicators (e.g. badges, overlays, or labels).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Note

Some streams may **not work properly in VLC or other external IPTV players**, as they require loading through a browser that supports **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**.

The website uses `hls.js` to ensure proper playback of these streams in a compatible environment.  
**For best results, use the website interface.**
